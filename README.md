## Atmosphere thickness calculator
 Main purpose of writing this program was to answer very important question i had during the summer.\
***If I went sunbathing at 9-10 a.m. or 2-3 p.m., would the effect be the same as if it was noon (12. p.m.)?***

So, you input date, location and what you think is the thickness of Earth atmosphere and the program tells you what is the actual atmosphere thickness that the sun radiation has to go through (as a function of time of the day) to reach your skin.

You can use terminal version (Atmo.py) or simple UI version (AtmoUI.py)
